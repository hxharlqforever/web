    Mr Trump did not say what conditions the US had set for the summit but, asked by a reporter about the North's arsenal, he said "denuclearisation must take place".
    The 12 June summit is due to take place in Singapore. It follows a summit between the two Korean leaders in April.
    North Korea is expected to dismantle a nuclear test site this week as a good will gesture but the demolition may be delayed by bad weather.
